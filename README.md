# Retail Trends & Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes retail customer shopping behavior to identify purchasing patterns,
revenue trends, and key business insights using transactional data.

The analysis was performed using Python for data exploration,
SQL for structured analysis, and Power BI for visualization.

## Business Objective
Retail teams often lack clear visibility into:
- Which customers contribute the most revenue
- How purchasing behavior changes over time
- Which product categories perform consistently

This project addresses these questions through data-driven analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer shopping transactions including purchase dates,
product categories, quantities, prices, and customer identifiers.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- SQL (analytical queries)
- Power BI (dashboard reporting)
- Excel (initial inspection)

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and validation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Customer behavior analysis
- SQL-based revenue and trend analysis
- Power BI dashboard creation

## Key Insights
- A limited group of customers contributes a significant share of total revenue
- Purchasing behavior shows clear time-based trends
- Product categories differ in revenue contribution
