# Retail Trends & Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using transactional retail data to identify
purchasing patterns, revenue drivers, and trends that support business decision-making.

The analysis was performed using Python for data processing and exploration,
SQL for structured analytics, and Power BI for interactive reporting.

## Business Problem
Retail businesses often have large volumes of transaction data but limited visibility into:
- Which customer segments drive the most revenue
- How purchasing behavior changes over time
- Which product categories perform consistently

This project addresses these challenges through data-driven analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer shopping transactions including purchase dates,
product categories, quantities, prices, and customer identifiers.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- SQL (aggregation and trend analysis)
- Power BI (dashboard and KPI reporting)
- Excel (initial data review)

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and validation
- Feature engineering for revenue calculation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- SQL-based customer and sales analysis
- Power BI dashboard creation for reporting

## Key Insights
- A small group of customers contributes a significant share of total revenue
- Purchasing behavior shows noticeable time-based trends
- Product categories differ in revenue contribution and consistency
